# Task 1 Findings
## Minimum and Maximum Distance
Min = 2cm
Max = 430cm     
Hallucinate = 1195cm

A grid was layed out of horizontal stripes. For the first 150cm the stripes were in intervals of 15cm. After that, the intervals were 25cm until 200cm. Then 50cm until 300cm. Finally, 8 values were taken of different intervals to find the maximum length which it measures. Up until 90cm, we used a small cuboid measuring 2cm. From 90-150cm, we used an object with a length of 7.5cm. For the values after, we used one which measured 9cm. For the final 8 values, we used a box which measured 25cm to ensure it was read.
